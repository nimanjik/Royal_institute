Salary Management Module - Royal Institute Project

This section contains about the salaries of the teachers.It maintains the salary details of each teacher.All these salaries are managed by the manager. The manager can create, delete, update and read salary details.The teachers' salaries will be finalized by assigning related allowances.Also, the teachers will be notified when the salaries are received.They are in charge of creating, updating, and deleting salary records, as well as generating reports and handling any salary-related issues.We deduct the amount suppliers as the free card by the teacher from the overall income, also we have to remove 25% of the total profit as the institute payment per class.
